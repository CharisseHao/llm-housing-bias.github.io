    <h3>Prompt 1: Apartment Inquiry</h3>

        <p>
            The first prompt we developed tested a more informal approach, simulating a landlord asking the LLM to score a tenant based on an email they sent. The primary variables tested—‘occupation,’ ‘living status,’ and ‘name’—were chosen for their potential to reveal disparities in model outcomes. ‘Occupation’ acts as a proxy for socioeconomic status, ‘living status’ examines potential bias against family units, and ‘name’ encodes race and gender without explicitly stating them, a technique that has been effective in revealing implicit bias in previous studies (Salinas 2024). In total, 285,120 prompts were tested across seven models.

    <h3>Prompt 2: Tenant Application</h3>
        <p> 
            To enhance our analysis and improve the generalizability of our results, the second prompt takes a more formal approach, simulating a landlord asking an LLM to score a tenant based on their application. The key variables tested include ‘eviction,’ which assesses how eviction history is perceived as a risk factor; ‘credit score,’ which evaluates the weight models place on financial history; and ‘name,’ which remains a proxy for race and gender. Unlike Prompt 1, this prompt included non-variable filler information, such as “employment information” and “rental history,” to mimic a landlord copying an application into an LLM. This filler content was kept consistent across all prompts to ensure it had no influence on the models’ decision-making in our audit.
